## What?

This repo is purely to practice / test git commands. We use it to learn new tricks and to show clients who are less familiar with Git workflows how this all works. 

It also includes [a guide for troubleshooting common issues](troubleshooting/README.md).

## Why?

Because it's a good idea to have a safe place to make mistakes when learning to use Git!

## Great, what kind of things should I try to do?

### Clone the repo

Using the command line, type

```
git clone https://github.com/cararthompson/sandbox.git

```

### Think of a nice quote you'd like to add to the "client-quotes.txt" file

It can be anything. Keep it classy!


### Create your own branch

You'll want to give it a clear name that relates to what you'd like to do within it. Something like "adding-einstein-quote" or "caras-new-quote" is fine. Git doesn't like spaces, so remember to use "kebab case" (which-looks-like-this) for your branch name!

To create your branch, replace `nice-new-name` below with your own branch name. 

```
git checkout -b nice-branch-name

```

## Make a change to `client-quotes.txt`; add, commit, push

That's all there is to it. As you do this, you'll notice that instead of `(main)`, you can see the name of your branch in the command line after the path to where you are. Paying attention to that goes a long way in keeping us all sane when working with branches!
